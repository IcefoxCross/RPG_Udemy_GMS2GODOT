## DISCLAIMER:
  **Heartbeast has allowed me to use the sprites from his GameMaker turn-based RPG course but has asked that anyone else using them only do so for educational purposes and not for commercial projects.**

## About
This project is the result of converting Heartbeast's **Make a Turn-Based RPG in GameMaker Studio 1.4** to the Godot Engine, with some documenting, it can be used as starting point or guide on how to make your own RPG battle system.
